%\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Agradecimentos}
First, I would like to thank my supervisors, Andr√© Restivo and Filipa Barros, whose commitment and guidance made this work possible. 

I also would like to thank my friends for all their support in the most challenging phases of this process. I am grateful for their willingness to lend a helping hand whenever I needed it, and for simply being there and offering emotional support during challenging times. Their friendship has made this whole process more fulfilling. A special thank you to Mariana Castro and Daniel Pontes, whose comradery and friendship provided much-needed decompression in the most stressful times.

Finally, I would like to thank my family which has always been there for me unconditionally, so that I could be where I am today.
