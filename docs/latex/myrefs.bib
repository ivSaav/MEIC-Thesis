  abstract = {Rolling bearing fault diagnosis is of great significance to the stable operation of rotating ma­ chinery systems. However, the fault data collected in practical engineering is seriously imbal­ anced, which degrades the diagnosis performance. In this paper, a novel data synthesis method called deep feature enhanced generative adversarial network is proposed to improve the per­ formance of imbalanced fault diagnosis. Firstly, to avoid the mode collapse phenomenon and improve the stability of the generative adversarial networks, a pull-away function is integrated to design a new objective function of the generator. Secondly, a self-attention module is utilized in the networks to enhance the deep features of real signals, thereby the quality of synthesized data is improved. Finally, an automatic data filter is established to timely ensure the accuracy and diversity of synthesized samples. Experiments are implemented on two rolling bearing datasets. The results indicate that the proposed method outperforms other intelligent methods and shows great potential in imbalanced fault diagnosis.},

publisher = {AAAI Press},
abstract = {Clustering algorithms are attractive for the task of class identification in spatial databases. However, the application to large spatial databases rises the following requirements for clustering algorithms: minimal requirements of domain knowledge to determine the input parameters, discovery of clusters with arbitrary shape and good efficiency on large databases. The well-known clustering algorithms offer no solution to the combination of these requirements. In this paper, we present the new clustering algorithm DBSCAN relying on a density-based notion of clusters which is designed to discover clusters of arbitrary shape. DBSCAN requires only one input parameter and supports the user in determining an appropriate value for it. We performed an experimental evaluation of the effectiveness and efficiency of DBSCAN using synthetic data and real data of the SEQUOIA 2000 benchmark. The results of our experiments demonstrate that (1) DBSCAN is significantly more effective in discovering clusters of arbitrary shape than the well-known algorithm CLAR-ANS, and that (2) DBSCAN outperforms CLARANS by a factor of more than 100 in terms of efficiency.},
